    "In many situations we have J jobs to do and P processors available.  If each job takes $T_j$ time, it would helpful to have an automated procedure for launching jobs on processes in such a way that each process uses approximately $W_p$ total work, where\n",

The advantage of this approach is that the processes will be automatically launched, and results automatically collected and returned.  The steps in launching a pool are as follows : \n",

    "\n",
    "4.  Launch the pool of workers.  There are two conceptual ways to launch jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use `apply` or `apply_async`.  This will launch a single job, with a single argument, using a process from the pool.   Multiple processes can be launched with multiple calls to `apply` or `apply_async`. \n",
